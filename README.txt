When reading the TrialQuestions_Q1toQ4.txt document, for your readability open it in notepad++ or copy and paste it into an ide so that the comments don't mess up the format as you read.

I have put the original code and quesiton in the document under original and my answer, the edited code under the original, labeled as edited.
