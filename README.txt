When reading the TrialQuestions_Q1toQ4.txt document, for your readability open it in notepad++ or copy and paste it into an ide so that the comments don't mess up the format as you read.

I have put the original code and quesiton in the document under original and my answer, the edited code under the original, labeled as edited.

You can find Q5 reproduction video in the main folder, TSFMyFiles are the files I made for this part of the trial.

You can find Q7 reproduction video in the main folder, OTClientMyfiles are the files I made for this part of the trial.

I did have to take the option to skip Question 6 since I didn't have time to do it.
